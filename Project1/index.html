			<h3>What's this about</h3>
			<p>These types of blogs always have some kind of long-winded, pretentious intro about how the author
			had some kind of life changing experience with food. I'm going to keep it short and sweet. I want
			to provide cheap recipes that taste pretty good. That's it. If you want a long-winded backstory, see 
			the about me below. Otherwise there's a couple recipes at the top to get started.</p>

			<h4>About Me</h4>
			<img class="img-thumbnail" src= "images/sammy/third.jpg" alt="Photo of steak sandwich">
			<p>When I was a kid, my family fell on some hard times. We went from being able to get whatever food we wanted
			to penny pinching and coupon scrounging just so that we had enough to not go hungry. Since my mom was working all the time,
			it fell to me to feed my brothers. The problem was that, being a dumb teenager, I had no idea how to cook. All the recipes I looked
			up seemed very out of touch with situations like mine. Even "budget" recipes would be something like $10 a meal when <em>my</em> budget 
			wasn't nearly as large. Quick food math, 4 people eating two meals a day(thanks free school lunches) is 56 meals a week. On my weekly
			food budget of $75, I had to make meals that were about a buck and some change per person. We ate a lot of bland rice and beans for a few years.</p>
			
			<p>I eventually got my first real job as a cook. Still broke, but I gained enough of a skillset to make sure my rice and beans were a 
			a bit more tastey. Plus I was surrounded by other broke cooks, and it's a common pasttime in the kitchen to brag about making something 
			that tastes great but was absurdly cheap. So I learned how to find the cheapest produce, make sauces or broths out of scrap, and stretch
			a single portion of protein over three meals.</p>
			
			<p> So that's my long-winded and pretentious backstory. In my experience two keys to eating cheap is to buy produce and protein that is processed 
			as little as possible and using ingredients that can be combined into many different things. I'm going to try and keep the recipes under $2 a portion
			unless I use leftovers or something like that. Probably throw in a few useful tips as well.
			</p>
			
			<p>If you want some extra reading, these two books have been very inspirational for me. The first <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-Fully-Revised-Updated/dp/1501169718" target="_blank">Joy of Cooking</a>
			by Irma Rombauer is one of the best gifts I've ever recieved. It has so many homestyle recipes, and it includes a lot of tips to become a better cook. A more advanced option is 
			Escoffier's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Escoffier-Auguste/dp/047090027X/" target="__blank">Le Guide Culinaire</a> contains classic French recipes from the famous chef. It definitely will not hold
			your hand, as it assumes knowledge of various cooking techniques, but thihnk of it as something to work to. If you can cook something out of that book, you can cook anything.
