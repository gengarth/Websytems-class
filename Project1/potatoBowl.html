			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>I make this for breakfast all the time. It's quick, filling, and you can prep the ingredients whenever you want.
			I often prep extra so that the next day I can just throw it all together the next day. This is just a base, so you
			can throw whatever extras you want. Cheese, sauces, mushrooms, ham, all kinds of extra goodies would go perfectly in this.</p>

			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Small dice your produce.</li>
				<li>Put a medium pan on medium-high heat, add a tablespoon of cooking oil.</li>
				<li>Add the potatoes and toss so that they are covered in the oil. Cook for ~five minutes, tossing occasionally.</li>
				<li>Crack your eggs into a small non-stick pan. Cook however you prefer, but I prefer sunny-side up for reasons I'll make clear in the tips.</li>
				<li>Add the peppers and onions to the potatoes, give it a quick toss, and cook until tender, ~2 minutes.</li>
				<li>Add salt and pepper, then toss before putting it into a bowl. Slide your eggs on top and you're ready to enjoy!</li>

			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<p>So you can use whatever cooking oil you want, but I recommend some cheap olive oil. The expensive extra virgin stuff has a very low smoke point. 
			You want to do a dice that's about 1 cm thick. You can dice it larger but it will take longer to cook. I like sunny-side or over easy eggs with 
			this recipe. When you crack the yolk, the heat from the cooked produce will cook it a little bit so that it becomes like a nice thick sauce.</p>
