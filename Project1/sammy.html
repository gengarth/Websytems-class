			<h3>Intro</h3>
			<p>This is a bit on the higher side, and you may be skeptical of some of the ingredient prices. But its just a great example of
			the use leftovers and taking advantage of deals. Everything except the steak and onions were bought on a BOGO, which essentially
			takes the unit price down by half. The steak was a great deal I got on some sirloin, $6/lb. I grilled it and ate half, now we get to repurpose 
			it into a sandwich. You could use any cut but the cheapest cuts you'll want to tenderize a bit. Caloriewise, this thing is a meal in itself,
			but if you want a bit more balanced nutrition, it goes great with some fries or a basic salad.</p>

			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<p>When you slice the steak do it agaisnt the grain so it's more tender. You may think toasting the bun is optional. It's not. Even a 
			toasted bun isi going to get a bit soggy with all that steak juice, much less an untoasted one. Same for the build order. You want those 
			onions on the bottom to provide as much of a barrier as possible. The steak is probably already seasoned from the orginial cook,
			but you want to season it in the pan again anyway. When you slice it up, you essentially create a lot more unseasoned surface area that 
			needs to be corrected.</p>
